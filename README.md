# spoken_english
## Using Python, we are converting a paragraph of spoken English to written English.

# Note:

Here We are not using any library doing all manualy.
otherwise for different Cases we can use specific libraries.

# Here are listed some possible future functionalities that can be covered in the future versions of the module:

1) If the paragraph contains a money figure e.g. two million three thousand nine hundred and eighty-four then we may convert it to numbers as 2003984.

2) Handling of both American number system and Indian number system e.g. million, lakhs.

3) Handling of Dates e.g. Today's Date is twenty-eight October two thousand twenty as Today's Date is 28-10-2020/2020-10-28.

4) Handling of Punctuation.

5) Handling of proper spaces after one sentance.
